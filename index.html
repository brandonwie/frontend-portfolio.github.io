        <h3>Creativity is what I love the most!</h3>
          <p>&nbsp;I’m an arising web developer who loves all about creations on the web. As I studied in <em>Film &amp; Theater</em>, I love to create something that is beautiful and touching.
            <!-- I know I should not use 'br' for the sake of aesthetics, but I didn't learn yet from Treehouse what to use to write on the next line. 'p' contains preset-empty-spaces up and down and I didn't want to make another paragraph. You feedback will be helpful. Thank you. -->
             I’m more than happy to bring my life experience to the process of building websites and web applications.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;I was an independent film maker, a manager and a salesman. I am a enthusiastic life-long learner who's always interested in getting new knowledge and expanding my skills.</p>
        <p>Now, I live in Dubai, am looking forward to see myself after 6 months as a programmer on the field!</p>
